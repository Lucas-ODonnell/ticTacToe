# Rainbow Tic Tac Toe

This is my tic tac toe project for the odin project. It is made with html, css, and vanilla javascript.

The default players are John Doe and Jane Doe with the pieces X and O.
However, you can edit the players to choose a different name and piece. Limitations are the piece can only be one character. Once someone 
has placed a piece on the board the edit player buttons are disabled.

The game runs until:

  - One of the players win.

  - It's a draw.

  - A player presses the reset button.


At the end of the game an alert will pop up stating the name of the winner and their piece.
To start a new game you need to manually press the reset button.
